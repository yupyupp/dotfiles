# Stephen Haffner dotfiles
This repository contains redacted copies of the config files for some of the programs I use. Config file templates and directions for each program and its supporting programs is contained in its own folder. (eg - the config files for mutt, offlineIMAP, msmtp, etc.  are contained in the mutt folder). 

## Folders
 - mutt
   - mutt
   - offlineIMAP
   - msmtp
   - python-pycard

## Coming Soon
 - irssi with xmpp support
 - zsh
 - More as I think of them :)

## Notes
 - These are the config files that work for me, they might not work exactly how you want them to.
 - Any file/folder that is named "DOT.*" needs to be renamed ".*" I added "DOT" to front of the name so it wouldn't be hidden when you downloaded it.
